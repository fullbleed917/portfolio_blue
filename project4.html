				<p>Zushi Resturant, based in Mesa, Arizona has been in buisness for 7 years. A well
							established Sushi and Japanese Bistro that has recently expanded to offer Tappanyaki
							to there local customers.</p>

				<div>
							<p>As a result of their expansion and new remodel they  were in need of an online prescense
								that accurrately portrays their brand, connects with customers and provides a
								better user experience. The new website was designed to  incorporate  modern
								 features such as a online reservation system. <!--This will allow patrons to place reservations
								with their computer, laptop or mobilie devise, quickly and easily. Social media integration
								for customers to post feedback and share their experience with their friends.--> A google map API
								location feature to better connect with clients trying to locate the resturant for the
								first time,be it for social gatherings or a happy hour meetup or buisness dinner with clients.

								<h2>Previous Site Analysis </h2>
										<p>Client has an existing site that is that did not provide any real
											 imapact on the buisness. There was no
										 	 functionality. The User experience was very poor. There was no real brand strategy or effective communication with thes customers
										  	It was ineffective in three key areas. It failed to	Improve Brand Awareness as there was little usable information and content
												<br><br>
												The site failed to build stronger customer relationships as there was no attempt to connect with the client base with social media, no
												testimonials or social proofing for potential clients. The images were not professional looking. pixellated and poor lighting and use of colors
	 											and the site failed to increase sales by not offering online booking of the Tappanyaki resturant<br>

																	<h2>OUTCOME & FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS </h2>
																			<p>The redesign was well received within the company and much to our delight, the new design opened up the owner to expanding the scope of the build to a future iteration with a more indepth backend, performing better than the old one in key areas.
																					<br><br>
																				While this was a very basic application with a short timeline, I think for future considerations, it would have been benefical to spend more time on user testing by creating more interactive prototypes and running a few more variations.<br>
																					<br>
																					As a whole very happy with how the site has come along and is moving towards hitting the customers goals and more.
